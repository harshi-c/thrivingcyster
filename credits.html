<p>This project is created by me, Harshal Chandwani for my MA Digital Media Design Final Project, focusing on using technology in raising awareness and providing valuable information to help individuals manage Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). <br><br>
Credit for the content goes to Rashi Chowdhary, an esteemed nutritionist with nearly 12 years of practice, specializing in Hormonal conditions and Gut Health, as well as Tallene Hacatoryan, a proficient nutritionist practising for 8 years, renowned for her specialization in PCOS. They have shared an abundance of valuable insights and information, helping people all around the world manage PCOS.
