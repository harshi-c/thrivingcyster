Created by me, Harshi Chandwani as part of my MA Digital Media Design Final Project, this prototype website is a labour of love inspired by my personal journey with PCOS.

I've designed this website as a space for holistic, dietary suggestions to help individuals manage PCOS. It's crucial to note that it does not offer official medical advice or rely on medical research. PCOS is complex, affecting people differently, and this project is all about learning and sharing together.

A heartfelt thank you goes to my dedicated supervisors, Joseph Muller and Rebekah Cupitt, for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this journey. Additionally, a warm appreciation for my family and friends for their unwavering encouragement and belief in this endeavor.
